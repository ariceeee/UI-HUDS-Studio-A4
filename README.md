## Demo

Ok for this one I got creative and recorded 2 demos to hopefuly convey all functionality:

1. Laptop screen recording, very laggy as usual running OBS and Unity at same time
2. Used my phone to record my laptop screen. Please note I have a flip phone, so the fact that this ended up being _less_ laggy than my $2,000 laptop is pretty sad. The purpose of including this second demo is that, even though it's a bit shaky (since I'm trying to film and demo at the same time) and not ideal quality, you can actually see the score animation happen. The other recording is so laggy that you can't even tell it's there.

Without further ado, please enjoy this week's special edition double feature demo!!
